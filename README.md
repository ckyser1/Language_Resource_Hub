Language Resource Hub by Shaw and Kyser

A webpage that acts as a resource hub for coding information.
The idea being a one stop location for information, youtube guides, and job posts.

As a potential employee, I want to be able to conveniently search by a skill, so that I may see helpful resources and jobs that may interest me.
For instance, by clicking the Javascript button.  Information on Javascript, as well as matching job criteria are shown.
